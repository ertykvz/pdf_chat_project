# PDF Chat API

This project allows users to upload PDF files and ask questions about the content of the uploaded PDFs using a chat-like system.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload

4. Open your browser and access the API documentation:  
   [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

   The **/docs** page provides an interactive UI to test the API endpoints without needing to use `curl` or command-line tools. You can upload PDF files, ask questions, and view responses directly from this interface.

## Endpoints

### 1. `/upload_pdf/` (POST)
- **Description**: Upload a PDF file and extract its content.
- **Request Body**: PDF file (e.g., `file` field).
- **Response**: Returns the unique `pdf_id` to reference the uploaded PDF.

### 2. `/chat_about_pdf/{pdf_id}` (POST)
- **Description**: Ask questions about the uploaded PDF using its unique `pdf_id`.
- **Parameters**:
- `pdf_id`: The ID of the uploaded PDF.
- `question`: The question you want to ask about the PDF.
- **Response**: Returns the answer generated by the model.

## Example Usage

1. **Upload a PDF**:
- Go to `/docs` in your browser.
- Use the **POST** `/upload_pdf/` endpoint to upload the PDF.
- Get the `pdf_id` from the response.

2. **Chat with the PDF**:
- Use the **POST** `/chat_about_pdf/{pdf_id}` endpoint to ask questions about the uploaded PDF.
- For example, ask: "What is the summary of this PDF?" or "Who is the main character?"

## Technologies Used
